 * Decide whether the TEXT counterfactual's prefix was warm this turn, and what

 *
 * Warmth is the honest UNION of two independent witnesses that the text prefix
 * was cached this turn — warm iff EITHER fires:
 *
 *   1. WALL CLOCK — a fresh same-session prior within `ttlSec`. The text prefix
 *      is append-only and shares the session's prompt-cache TTL, so a recent
 *      prior turn proves it is still cached even when pxpipe busted its OWN image
 *      cache (cr === 0) by re-rendering the prefix in place this turn. This leg
 *      is decoupled from the image's cache state; the old `cr > 0`-only rule
 *      lacked it and mispriced cache-busted re-renders COLD, turning a real
 *      re-imaging LOSS into a fabricated "saving".
 *
 *   2. OBSERVED READ — cr > 0 directly witnesses Anthropic serving a cached
 *      prefix this turn. This rescues the first turn after a pxpipe restart /
 *      SESSION_CAP eviction while the cache is still warm (no in-memory prior,
 *      yet cr proves warmth). Without it that turn is priced COLD and fabricates
 *      an inflated "saved" row — the operator's original reported bug.
 *
 * Crucially, cr === 0 does NOT force cold when the prefix hash is unchanged
 * (leg 1 carries those turns); cr is only an ADDITIONAL sufficient witness,
 * never a necessary one. But a fresh prior with a different prefix hash is cold:
 * it is a different provider cache key, not an append-only continuation.
 * See docs/CACHING_AND_SAVINGS.md.
 *
 * @param prev       this session's previous usage-bearing turn, or undefined.
 * @param nowSec     wall-clock seconds of the current turn (replay passes the
 *                   persisted ts so it reproduces the live decision exactly).
 * @param cacheable  this turn's cacheable-prefix tokens (the full-reuse credit
 *                   when warm only via cr, since cr proves a read but not the split).
 * @param cr         observed cache-read tokens this turn (the leg-2 witness).
 * @param ttlSec     cache TTL window (defaults to CACHE_TTL_SEC).
 * @param prefixSha  stable-prefix fingerprint for the text counterfactual. A
 *                   fresh wall-clock prior only proves warmth when this matches
 *                   the prior turn; otherwise the provider would see a new key.

 * Weighted input cost for the unproxied TEXT counterfactual (see docs/CACHING_AND_SAVINGS.md).
 *
 * Warmth matters: a TEXT prefix is only a cheap cache-read when a warm cache
 * actually existed this turn. The previous warmth-FREE version always priced
 * the cacheable prefix at CACHE_READ_RATE, which fabricated a "free read" on
 * cold/TTL-expiry turns where text would in fact have paid a 1.25× create —
 * that produced a phantom loss vs the imaged path (which DOES pay the create).
 *
 *   cold turn (first turn / >5min since this session's last turn):
 *     text has no warm cache either ⇒ cacheable×CACHE_CREATE_RATE + coldTail×1.0
 *   warm turn (a prior turn cached the prefix within TTL):
 *     text append-caches ⇒ reused×CACHE_READ_RATE + grown×CACHE_CREATE_RATE + coldTail×1.0
 *     where reused = min(prevCacheable, cacheable), grown = cacheable − reused.
 *     This is what TEXT pays regardless of whether pxpipe's image busted its
 *     own cache on a growth turn — so the real growth loss is preserved.
 *
 * Saving = baseline_eff − actual_eff; can be negative (honestly reported, not floored).
 *
 * @param baselineCacheable  tokens up to the last cache_control marker. ≤0 ⇒ credit nothing.
 * @param warm               was a warm cache available for this session this turn?
 * @param prevCacheable      cacheable prefix size on this session's previous turn (warm only).
